#Day 06

#Linked List Insertions

## Code Challenge 06

## Challenge

Created 3 methods, one that takes in a value and append the value on the very last of linked lists.

Another method that is called beforeInsertion (2 airty), looks for the specific value and add it before the value.

Another method that is called AfterInsertion (2 airty), looks for the specific value and add it after the value.

#Day 07

#linked List K-th from the end

## Code Challenge 07

## Challenge

Create a kth from end method that takes in 1 airty value (distance), to find the node that is the distance away from the last linked node.

Solved it by adding a follower tracker and starting it when it reach the threshold of the distance. It reads the value of that node and return exception when the distance is greater than the actual link length

Checked up on the structure and debugged some errors.
